    About Commercial Bank of Ethiopia
One of the predominant banks operating in Ethiopia is the Commerical Bank of Ethiopia, AKA CBE. Way before its establishment, the bank was under the State Bank of Ethiopia, which was founded in 1942. That led the way for CBE to be founded separately in 1963, before its unification with the, back then, Addis Ababa Bank in 1974.

The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia has more than 22 million account holders who can be entertained by a number of services. With money digitization in mind, the bank has now more than two and a half million internet banking users as of last year.

CBE is the first bank to introduce modern banking to Ethiopia. It was once the leading African banks with assets of 485.7 billion Birr as of June 30th, 2017. It now has over 1500 branches across the country and plays a significant role in the economic progress and development of the country.

CBE is also the first bank to introduce Western Union Money Transfer Services in the country and currently working with more than twenty money transfer agents like Atlantic International, Xpress Money, and Money Gram. CBE has reliable and enduring relationships with internationally recognized banks across the world.
